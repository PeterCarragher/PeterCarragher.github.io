bio:
  I’m a PhD student at the <a href='https://www.cmu.edu/casos-center/' target='_blank'> Center for Computational Analysis of Social and Organizational Systems (CASOS) </a> and <a href='https://www.cmu.edu/ideas-social-cybersecurity/' target='_blank'>Center for Informed Democracy & Social - cybersecurity (IDeaS)</a> at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by <a href='http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/bios/carley/carley.html' target='_blank'>Dr. Kathleen M. Carley</a> and <a href='https://patpark.org/' target='_blank'>Dr. Patrick Park</a>.


  My research primarily focuses on modeling trust in digital news media. To this end, my work assesses source credibility in digital news media and develops interventions to promote credible sources in information systems such as search engines. Given media trust is declining over time, I am interested in the wider set of factors that affect media trust, audience behavior, and media literacy. The methods I use for this research place me at the intersection of computational social science and media studies.


  In the past I was lucky to be supervised by Dr. Ashok Goel in the <a href='https://dilab.gatech.edu/' target='_blank'>Design Intelligence Laboratory (DILab)</a> at Georgia Insitute of Technology, researching the roles of intellgient agents in educational environments. Prior to this, I developed machine learning trust and safety systems at Meta, where my work has been deployed in areas of such as coordinated inauthentic behavior and election integrity.
