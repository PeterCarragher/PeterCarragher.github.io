bio:
  Iâ€™m a PhD student at the <a href='https://www.cmu.edu/casos-center/' target='_blank'> Center for Computational Analysis of Social and Organizational Systems (CASOS) </a> and <a href='https://www.cmu.edu/ideas-social-cybersecurity/' target='_blank'>Center for Informed Democracy & Social - cybersecurity (IDeaS)</a> at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by <a href='http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/bios/carley/carley.html' target='_blank'>Dr. Kathleen M. Carley</a> and <a href='https://patpark.org/' target='_blank'>Dr. Patrick Park</a>.

  My research primarily focuses on developing search-based interventions, assessing source credibility in online news media, and modeling social influence processes in social media. Utilizing an interdisciplinary approach, I integrate techniques from network science and machine learning with theories from social and information sciences. I use these methods to study information diffusion and retrieval systems, with the aim of enhancing the reliability of the online information ecosystem.

  In the past I was lucky to be supervised by Dr. Ashok Goel in the <a href='https://dilab.gatech.edu/' target='_blank'>Design Intelligence Laboratory (DILab)</a> at Georgia Insitute of Technology, researching the roles of intellgient agents in educational environments. Prior to this, I developed machine learning detection and response systems at Meta, where my work has been deployed in areas of fraud and deception such as impersonation, coordinated inauthentic behavior, and election integrity.
