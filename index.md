Iâ€™m a PhD student at the <a href='http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/' target='_blank'> Center for Computational Analysis of Social and Organizational Systems </a> and <a href='https://www.cmu.edu/ideas-social-cybersecurity/' target='_blank'>IDeaS Center</a> at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by <a href='http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/bios/carley/carley.html' target='_blank'>Kathleen M. Carley</a> and <a href='https://patpark.org/' target='_blank'>Patrick Park</a>.

My work combines methods from natural language processing, network science, and machine learning with theories from linguistics and the social sciences.
I research within the fields of computational social science, computational linguistics, and digital humanities.
